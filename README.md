# Matts-Portfolio
Assignment Description:

For this assignment we were tasked with creating a portfolio from scratch, using what we learned from html and CSS.
The benefits of creating a portfolio are far reaching.  For one, it is great practise for practising html and CSS.  It also has real world applications in that it 
is a great way to showcasw your design skills and projects to potential employers.
